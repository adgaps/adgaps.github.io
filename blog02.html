	<p class="post_title">Perspectives</p>
	<p>Through the years of reading so many history books (at least 120 in the past 9 years, yes that's a big deal for me) I've developed a keen interest on how historians present their study. By that I refer to what viewpoints they take, what topics they emphasize and what they don't.</p>
	<p>There's multiple ways to present even a single historical subject, depending on what the historian wants to argue. When I pick up a book, I want to know what perspective the author takes. A book on the First World War, for example, may look at it from a military perspective, delving into the individual battles, the army formations, the decisions made by commanders from the very top to the smallest units.</p>
	<p>Another book may look at the conflict from a top-heavy political and diplomatic lens, focusing on how state leaders negotiated with their own governments, with their allies, and even with the enemies. Or yet another book may put a spotlight on how the War was seen by the individual soldiers and the civilian society, how their respective cultures affected their attitude to being thrown into the trenches, and how that conflict came to be remembered by future generations.</p>
	<p>See, there's not a single way to present historical facts. As much as people would desire history that is objective and unbiased, that's actually not how it works. Both historians and the people they study about are humans. There will always be hints of subjectivity in history, no matter how small. This doesn't mean that the history presented is bad, as long as it treated the facts properly and arguments are formed in good faith.</p>
	<p>And to me, that's the joy of learning history through these books I read. I eagerly want to see the perspective the historian takes, how they think their topic should be framed and presented. It's like peering into the writer's mind, wanting to see history as they see it. This also means that each book, despite covering a similar subject with many others, is like a fresh new journey for me. It's always a new conversation.</p>
