	<p class="post_title">Fascination</p>
	<p>One day in 2017, I was browsing the history shelf at the bookstore, and came across the book <b>The Sleepwalkers</b>, by <i>Christopher Clark</i>. I didn't know anything about the First World War beyond the fact that the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand was the cause of the conflict. I didn't even know what year the incident happened! So I bought the book out of curiosity. And there my fascination about the history of the First World War had begun.</p>
	<p>I'd rather not call it an obssession, because that's quite a charged word to use, and also sounds really weird in the context. I'd say it's a sort of fascination and, generally, strong preference to learning about the First World War compared with any other subject a history buff would engage in. At least in my side of the world the  First World War has very little prominence and significance, as opposed to the Second World War which was more recent, more widely discussed, and more directly relevant to my country's history. I personally think it appealing to dive into a subject not commonly covered in popular history.</p>
	<p>So yeah I have a strong fascination with the history of First World War. I am not a big fan of military history, however. Topics like military strategies and conduct, filled with details of war equipment, formations, and movements, aren't the most appealing to me. Even with the maps supplied within the history books, it can be a bit hard for me to follow along the (literal) blow-by-blow narration of troop formations and movements. I do read up on such topics sometimes, but other aspects of the War interest me more.</p>
	<p>The ones that do appeal to me are focused on political and diplomatic histories of the First World War. These books are still riddled with names and dates (frankly I don't bother memorizing them), but what interests me the most is history that dives into the intricacies of governments and institutions, of their motivations and machinations, and of the War as seen from all levels of government and society. I like learning about how these leaders interacted with each other, how they framed their decisions, how they read the enemies' actions, how they conducted the War from their rooms and halls far from the trenches.</p>
	<p>Of course it's not to say that some histories are better than others. Okay, maybe there are such instances. But overall, there's so many viewpoints from which to look at any given historical subject, and merging them all in a single book is an impossibility unless some compromises have to be made. Those compromises aren't by themselves bad either. It's just a practical consequence of trying to fit in as much of a massively complex historical event as possible within a book that could realistically be read by a regular person.</p>
	<p>My point is that I have some preferred ways of learning history, and I prefer theses and arguments over detailed military statistics, and even over more "polished" treatment that's suitable for general readers. I love the kind of history that covers <i>how</i> history is written and discussed. That kind of treatment is known as historiography, but the books I like to read aren't exclusively historiographical studies either.</p>
	<p>I love the kind of history where I can peer through the historian's mind. To be fair, I do expect them to lay that out at the start of the book. I wanna know the historian's view more than how the general reader wants history to be viewed. Is Germany really to blame? Why didn't any of the belligerent countries try to resolve it through diplomatic means? How and why did the conflict last as long as it did? Was it really a war of attrition? I want the kind of books where the historian argues where they stand on their field's historiographical debates.</p>
	<p>And now I go back to that book I picked up on that day. <b>The Sleepwalkers</b> emphasizes the primacy of "how" over "why": the latter seeks to find blame, the former seeks to trace a process. How did the First World War began? The book outlines the evolution of political and diplomatic alignments in Europe in the half-century prior to 1914. A continent that wove an entangled mess of treaties and alliances found itself sleepwalking into a war which everyone thought would be over by Christmas. Sure, the author gave a lot more leniency for the Central Powers than conventional narratives of the War do. But the point is that, instead of hunting down a culprit to vilify, the book shows that history cannot simply be reduced to a singular event, and that behind that one catalyst is a complex story that ought to be the focus instead.</p>
	<p>Reading this book as my first foray into First World War history has practically changed the way I approach history in general. When I say I prefer the arguments over the simplified narrative, it's because of <b>The Sleepwalkers</b>. It's definitely the one First World War book I'd recommend the most. Soon after finishing it, I read book after book after book on the First World War, in just a span of a few months.</p>
	<p>Today, even as I've been exploring many other history subjects, it's the First World War history that I keep coming back to. Admittedly, I probably can't properly explain even just a general overview of the War, but part of this blog's purpose is to help me articulate what I know and improve on it as time goes.</p>
